# PayanList Project v1.0.0-beta

PAYANLIST is a task management project built entirely with the Laravel framework, intentionally staying within the Laravel ecosystem. It uses Blade templates for the frontend, combined with a mix of vanilla JavaScript, a few lightweight JavaScript libraries, and TailwindCSS for styling.

The application allows you to organize your work by creating separate environments and assigning multiple tasks to each. Although originally built as a personal practice project, don't let that fool you — PAYANLIST offers robust task management features that make it a practical and powerful tool for real-world.

This project is currently open-source and available for exploration. There is also potential for it to evolve into a full SaaS platform in the future. Maybe i do that in the future --.(0_0).--
